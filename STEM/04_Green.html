                        <li>A sturdy cardboard box (e.g., shoe box, cereal box, or delivery box – around 30x20x15 cm)</li>
                        <li>10-15 empty plastic bottles (e.g., 500ml or 1-liter soda/water bottles), with the bottom part cut off, leaving just the top and neck.</li>

                    <ol class="instruction-list text-lg text-gray-700 pl-5">
                        <li>**Prepare the Box:** Choose one large side of your cardboard box. Carefully cut out a rectangular opening in the center of this side, leaving a border of a few centimeters.</li>
                        <li>**Cut Bottle Holes:** On the rectangular opening you just created, mark and cut circular holes. Each hole should be just big enough for the neck of a plastic bottle to fit snugly. Arrange them in a grid pattern.</li>
                        <li>**Insert Bottles:** From the *outside* of the box, push the cut plastic bottle tops into the holes. The wider, open end of the bottle should face outwards, towards the warm air. The narrow neck should stick into the box.</li>
                        <li>**Secure with Glue:** Apply strong glue around the base of each bottle neck where it meets the cardboard, both inside and outside the box. Make sure all bottles are firmly attached and there are no gaps for air to escape around them.</li>
                        <li>**Position Your Cooler:** Place your finished eco-cooler fan in a window that gets warm air or sunlight.</li>
                        <li>**Test the Airflow:** Hold a thin strip of tissue paper or your hand near the inside openings of the bottle necks. Do you feel air moving? How does it feel compared to the air outside?</li>
                        <li>**Measure Temperature (Optional):** If you have a thermometer, record the room temperature before placing the eco-cooler. Then, record it again after 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours.</li>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        Set up a table below or in your science notebook. Record your temperature readings (if using a thermometer) and describe how the airflow feels (e.g., "slightly cooler," "strong breeze," "no change").

                    <h2 class="text-blue-700">💡 What’s Happening?</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
                        This amazing effect is based on a principle called **adiabatic expansion**! When warm air from outside is forced through the narrow neck of the bottle, it speeds up. As it expands rapidly into the wider space inside the box, the air molecules spread out. This expansion causes the air to lose energy and cool down, making the air inside your box feel cooler! It's a simple yet effective way to use physics for natural cooling, similar to how some traditional buildings in hot countries are designed.

                        **Design Experiment:** What if you used more or fewer bottles? How about bottles of different shapes (e.g., wide-mouth vs. narrow-mouth)? Try building different versions and compare their cooling effects. Which design works best and why?

                            <ul class="list-circle pl-5">
                                <li>Is it sunny, cloudy, partly cloudy, or stormy?</li>
                                <li>Is it raining, snowing, or dry?</li>
                                <li>How strong is the wind, and from which direction is it blowing?</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>**Record Using Symbols:** For each day, draw a small weather symbol in the calendar box (e.g., a sun for sunny, a cloud for cloudy, raindrops for rain, wind lines for windy). You can also write down the temperature.</li>
                        <li>**Analyze Monthly Data:** At the end of the month, count how many days were sunny, how many were rainy, how many were cloudy, etc.</li>
                        <li>**Create a Chart:** Use your counts to create a pie chart or bar graph. This will visually show the dominant weather types for the month.</li>

                        You're doing exactly what meteorologists and climate scientists do! Weather is what you see outside right now (e.g., "It's sunny today"). Climate, however, is the *average* weather over a long period (e.g., "Our summers are usually hot and sunny"). By collecting daily weather data, you start to see the bigger picture – the climate patterns of your local area! This data helps scientists understand how our planet's climate might be changing.

                    <ol class="instruction-list text-lg text-gray-700 pl-5">
                        <li>**Prepare the Potatoes:** Gently roll each potato on a table while pressing down lightly. This helps break up the internal structure and makes it easier for the chemical reaction to happen.</li>
                        <li>**Insert Electrodes:** For each potato, carefully push one zinc nail into one side and one piece of copper wire (or coin) into the other side. Make sure the zinc and copper are pushed deep into the potato but are *not* touching each other inside.</li>
                        <li>**Connect the Circuit (Series):** Use alligator clips to connect the copper wire from the *first* potato to the zinc nail of the *second* potato. If you have a third potato, connect the copper wire from the second potato to the zinc nail of the third. You're creating a "series" circuit, like linking train cars!</li>
                        <li>**Connect to LED:** Take the remaining zinc nail from the first potato in your chain and connect it with an alligator clip to one leg of the LED. Then, take the remaining copper wire from the last potato in your chain and connect it with an alligator clip to the other leg of the LED.</li>
                        <li>**Observe & Troubleshoot:** Watch your LED! Does it light up? If not, try these tips:
                            <ul class="list-circle pl-5">
                                <li>LEDs have a positive and negative side. If it doesn't light up, try swapping the LED's legs.</li>
                                <li>Make sure all connections are tight.</li>
                                <li>If the light is dim, try adding more potatoes to your chain (each potato adds more power!).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        This is super cool electrochemistry in action! The acid inside the potato (specifically, phosphoric acid) acts as an **electrolyte**. When you insert two different metals, like zinc and copper, into this electrolyte, a chemical reaction occurs. The zinc (a more reactive metal) loses electrons, and these electrons travel through the wires to the copper (a less reactive metal). This flow of electrons is what we call **electricity**! Each potato acts like a small **voltaic cell** or battery. When you connect multiple potatoes in a series, you increase the total voltage, giving you enough power to light up a tiny LED!

                        <li>**Create Filter Layers:** Inside your jar/bottle, carefully layer your filter materials. A good starting order is:
                            <ul class="list-circle pl-5">
                                <li>Bottom Layer: A thick layer of cotton (this traps larger particles).</li>

Ensure the fan is positioned to *pull* air *into* the filter layers (check the arrows on the fan or feel the airflow). Use tape or glue to create a tight seal around the fan so that all air is forced through your filter.</li>
                        <li>**Power It Up:** Plug your fan into the USB power bank or charger. The fan should start running, pulling air through your homemade filter.</li>
                        <li>**Test & Compare:** Place your mini air purifier in a slightly dusty area of your room or near a source of mild odors (e.g., a kitchen after cooking). After running it for an hour or more, carefully remove the top cotton layer. Compare the dust levels on the cotton inside your purifier versus a clean piece of cotton left exposed to the air outside the jar.</li>

                        Your fan creates a vacuum, pulling air through your filter layers. The **cotton** acts as a physical barrier, trapping larger particles like dust, pollen, and pet dander. **Activated charcoal** is a special material with millions of tiny pores that act like sponges, absorbing much smaller particles, odors, and even invisible gases called **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)**. This process helps to clean the air, making it safer and fresher to breathe! This is the same basic principle used in many industrial and home air purifiers.

                        **Filter Materials:** What if you added other layers to your filter? Try adding baking soda (known for absorbing smells), dried lavender or other herbs (for a fresh scent), or even coffee grounds. How do these additions change the purifier's effectiveness?
                        **Air Quality Test:** Can you find a way to measure the "cleanliness" of the air before and after using your purifier? (Hint: Some phone apps or simple DIY sensors can detect dust levels).

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
                        Your model demonstrates the core idea behind real-life **tsunami warning systems**! In the actual ocean, special deep-ocean buoys (called DART buoys) have highly sensitive pressure sensors on the seafloor. These sensors detect the subtle changes in water pressure caused by a tsunami wave passing overhead. Because tsunamis travel very fast but are often barely noticeable in the deep ocean, these sensors can detect them much earlier than they reach the coast. When a dangerous wave is detected, an alert is sent via satellite to warning centers, giving coastal communities precious time to evacuate and move to safety. Your sensor does a similar job, just on a smaller, safer scale!

                        **Tank Shape:** What if you made your tank a different shape (e.g., narrower, wider)? How would that change wave behavior and detection?
                        **Advanced Alerts:** Can you program your microcontroller to make the alarm louder, flash the LED in a specific pattern, or even send a simple message to a small LCD screen?

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
                        Plants can't speak, but with your soil moisture sensor, they can tell you when they're thirsty! The sensor works by measuring how easily electricity flows through the soil. Water conducts electricity better than dry soil, so when the soil is wet, the sensor reads a lower value (or higher, depending on sensor type), and when it's dry, it reads a higher value. Your microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino) constantly reads this data. When the reading crosses your "dryness threshold," it triggers the LED/buzzer, letting you know it's watering time! This is a simple but powerful example of the **Internet of Things (IoT)**, where everyday objects are connected and share data to help us make smarter decisions.

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
                        **Light Sensor:** Can you add a light sensor to your "Soil Doctor" to also check if your plant is getting enough light? Program it to alert you if the light levels are too low or too high.
                        **Automatic Watering:** For an advanced challenge, integrate a small water pump! Program your system to automatically turn on the pump and water the plant when the soil moisture drops below your set threshold.
                        **Data Logging:** If you have an ESP32, try sending your moisture and light data to a cloud platform (like Google Sheets or a simple web server) so you can monitor your plant's health from anywhere!

                        How can technology like this help farmers save water and grow healthier crops, especially in areas with limited water resources? What are other ways we can use sensors and IoT to help the environment or manage natural resources more efficiently?
